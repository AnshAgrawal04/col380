Note that "O3” is specific to GCC and LLVM compilers. “O3” enables a few of compiler 
optimizations. Optimization flags for GCC can be found at 
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html. In particular, see -ftree
vectorize, -fopt-info-vec-optimized, and –mavx512f. Your submissions should run with g++ 
version 11.2 with std c++17. (You may also try icpx.)  

The number of cache accesses and page faults on executing 
a given command (program). You will gather values and plot performance graphs for this 
assignment.

For each experiment, report the total number of cache misses and cache-hit rate (as 
a percent of total cache accesses), the CPU time taken by your execution, the CPU time 
taken by each matrixMultiplyXYZ routine, the percent of the  CPU time taken by 
matrixMultiplyXYZ, readMatrix, and writeMatrix functions (see below). Each should be 
graphed in a separate curve to be included in your report. Raw data should also be provided 
in the format listed later.
